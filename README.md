# Server-Selector
Open a private match in any region
Created by Punda#7771
To run this application you do need a PCVR Headset, such as a rift cv1, rift s or an oculus quest with a link cable.

This application allows you to run a private server in any region through a text console.

Make sure to know the location of the echovr.exe as you will need to input the path for the folder.

For example it should be something like this: 
D:\Games\Oculus\Software\ready-at-dawn-echo-arena\bin\win10

> For anyone looking at the source code, I know it is awful code but for me it's pretty good. It works as well so that's all that matters
